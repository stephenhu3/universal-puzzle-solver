Questions:

For the explanations, generally a sentence or two should be enough.
Type your answers directly in this file.


1.  Edit solve.cpp to use VectorPriorityQueue and LinkedListDict.
How long did it take to solve the 4x4 slider puzzle?  The 5x5?
The 6x6 (or how long did you wait before giving up)?  Also, record
what kind of computer you ran your experiments on.

MacBook Pro 2.53 GHz Core 2 Duo
- 4x4 Slider Puzzle:
Instantaneously (~0.35 s) in 129 steps.

- 5x5 Slider Puzzle:
Took 5 minutes 54 seconds in 551 steps.

- 6x6 Slider Puzzle:
Ran for 10 minutes without achieving the answer. Then I stopped.

2.  While still using VectorPriorityQueue, edit solve.cpp to use
your AVLDict implementation.
How long did it take to solve the 4x4, 5x5, and 6x6 slider puzzles?
Also, record what kind of computer you ran your experiments on.
This should be noticeably faster!

MacBook Pro 2.53 GHz Core 2 Duo
- 4x4 Slider Puzzle:
Instantaneously (~0.30 s) in 129 steps.

- 5x5 Slider Puzzle:
Took 24 seconds in 551 steps.

- 6x6 Slider Puzzle:
Took for 2 minutes 12 seconds in 601 steps.

3.  For each of the 4x4, 5x5, and 6x6 slider puzzles,
what was the average depth of the calls to find() recorded
in the statistics reported by the program?  Is this growing
as the puzzle size grows?

- 4x4 Slider Puzzle:
Average Depth of Calls = Sum of Weighted Call Depths / Number of Samples = 17

- 5x5 Slider Puzzle:
Average Depth of Calls = Sum of Weighted Call Depths / Number of Samples = 20

- 6x6 Slider Puzzle:
Average Depth of Calls = Sum of Weighted Call Depths / Number of Samples = 22

Yes, the average depth of the calls increased as the puzzle size grew. This effectively means the dictionary is larger when solving larger puzzle size.

4.  While still using VectorPriorityQueue, edit solve.cpp to use
your LinearHashDict implementation.
How long did it take to solve the 4x4, 5x5, and 6x6 slider puzzles?
Also, record what kind of computer you ran your experiments on.
How do these times compare with your AVLDict implementation?

5.  For each of the 4x4, 5x5, and 6x6 slider puzzles,
what was the average number of extra probes per call to find()
recorded in the statistics reported by the program?  Is this growing
as the puzzle size grows?

6.  While still using VectorPriorityQueue, edit solve.cpp to use
your DoubleHashDict implementation.
How long did it take to solve the 4x4, 5x5, and 6x6 slider puzzles?
Also, record what kind of computer you ran your experiments on.
How do these times compare with your LinearHashDict implementation?

7.  For each of the 4x4, 5x5, and 6x6 slider puzzles,
what was the average number of extra probes per call to find()
recorded in the statistics reported by the program?
How does this compare with your LinearHashDict implementation?
Why isn't DoubleHashDict that much faster?

TODO:

We will be checking your implementations of AVLDict, LinearHashDict,
and DoubleHashDict.
